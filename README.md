Problems are the first thing we encounter in real life. The password given to me to log in to the e-mail address was incorrect. That's why we had a short conversation and solved the problem with the mail password. Then I logged in to the email address and github account with the email and password information given to me. I did research on how to write the read me section on the Github account. As a result of my research, I started to enter the logs in the read me section. I installed Oracle Virtualbox on my computer. I did research on how to install ubuntu 18.04 on virtualbox. As a result of my research, I installed Ubuntu 18.04 on Oracle Virtualbox. In the problem determination section, I first identified the problem. The camera performs incorrect classification when classifying. Then I answered other questions. These questions are: How are the images obtained, where is the error, why is there a possibility of misclassification, and finally, I answered the questions of what kind of solution should be applied to solve this problem.
